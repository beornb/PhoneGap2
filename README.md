PhoneGap Test Project using Onsen UI
========

This project was created using the OnsenUI framework which is an extension on the Angular JS framework but it is specifically targetted at PhoneGAP.

So far in my initial testing it seems to run faster than jQuery mobile which was the main reason for adopting this framework.

The framework itself is quite basic, alot of the functionality that exists in Jquery mobile is not present in onsen ui, however I prefer to do the main formatting and navigation in the framework and then the detailed formatting in my own CSS.
